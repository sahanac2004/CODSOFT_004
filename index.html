                <h2>Childhood:</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan, born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family, displayed an early affinity for mathematics. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, worked as a clerk in a sari shop, while his mother, Komalatammal, was a devout housewife. Ramanujan's childhood was marked by his exceptional memory, quiet demeanor, and a deep curiosity about the world, particularly in mathematics. Despite facing challenges in formal education, he excelled in mathematics, winning academic prizes and demonstrating a natural talent for numbers. His love for mathematics was evident from a young age, and he spent his leisure time pondering mathematical problems and playing with numbers. Ramanujan's early life was characterized by his self-driven pursuit of mathematical knowledge, leading to his remarkable contributions to the field despite limited formal training.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <div class="left">
                <h2>Academics:</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan received his early education and schooling in Madras, where he attended a local school. His love for mathematics blossomed at a young age, and he was mostly self-taught in this field.</p>
                <p>Despite facing challenges in college due to excelling only in mathematics, Ramanujan continued to pursue his passion for mathematics. He was a promising student who won many academic prizes in high school.</p>
                <p>In 1912, Ramanujan secured a position as a clerk at the Madras Port Trust Office. His manager, S.N. Aiyar, encouraged him to reach out to G.H. Hardy, a renowned mathematician at Cambridge University. In 1913, Ramanujan sent a letter to Hardy with 120 theorems, showcasing his exceptional mathematical talent.</p>
                <p>Hardy and J.E. Littlewood analyzed Ramanujan's work and recognized it as a work of true genius. This recognition marked the beginning of Ramanujan's journey to becoming one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h2>Adulthood:</h2>
                <p>On July 14, 1909, at the age of 21, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal), a 9-year-old girl selected by his mother a year earlier. It was common at the time for marriages to be arranged with young girls[1][2].</p>
                <p>After the marriage, Ramanujan developed a hydrocele testis, a condition that could be treated with a routine surgery. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to perform the surgery at no cost[1].</p>
                <p>In late 1910, Ramanujan fell ill again and feared for his health. He asked his friend R. Radakrishna Iyer to hand over his notebooks to a mathematics professor in case he did not survive[1].</p>
                <p>In 1912, Ramanujan moved with his wife and mother to a house in George Town, Madras. In May 1913, he secured a research position at Madras University and moved with his family to Triplicane[1].</p>
                <p>In September 1913, Ramanujan wrote a letter to the Cambridge University mathematician G.H. Hardy, and it marked the beginning of his international collaboration in mathematics[1].</p>

                <h2>Death:</h2>
                <p>On April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, Ramanujan died of an illness, possibly of chronic encephalitis lethargica[1]. He was survived by his wife and mother.</p>
                <p>Despite his young age, Ramanujan's contributions to mathematics have left an indelible mark. He has been hailed as one of the greatest mathematical minds of all time[1].</p>

                <h2>Legacy:</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan's mathematical work is renowned for its depth, beauty, and simplicity. His findings in number theory, partial differential equations, and other fields of mathematics continue to be studied and admired by mathematicians around the world.</p>
                <p>The Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai, India, was named after Ramanujan. In addition, the prime numbers 17 and 29 were named after him.</p>
                <p>In the Indian city of Erode, where Ramanujan was born, the house where he spent his early years is now preserved as a museum, and his name has been used to name schools, streets, and even an airport. A sculpture of Ramanujan stands near his birthplace, and the government of India issued a postage stamp in his honor in 1997.</p>

                <h2>Work:</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan made groundbreaking contributions to several branches of mathematics, including number theory, analysis, and algebraic geometry. He also discovered formulas for calculating pi, a result known as Ramanujan's pi formula, which holds:</p>
                <p>π = 1/16 * (9*√2 - 9*√(2-2*√2) + 9*√(2+2*√2))</p>
                <p>He found numerous other identities and formulas related to π and the prime numbers, many of which remain unproven.</p>
                <p>Ramanujan also discovered formulas for the partition function and the summation of squares, as well as the famous "ramanujan beta function" for continued fractions. His work on the partition function has direct applications in physics, specifically in the field of string theory.</p>

                <h2>Recognition:</h2>
                <p>In recognition of his groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, Ramanujan has been hailed as one of the greatest mathematical minds of all time. His work has influenced many renowned mathematicians, including G.H. Hardy, John Edensor Littlewood, and E.T. Bell. Ramanujan's achievements continue to inspire mathematicians around the world, who study his work to this day.</p>
